# Academic CV

Adapted for Noveck J. Gowandan

The CV content and formatting conform to Karen Kelsky's guidelines for clearer information presentation and better typography. The CV's TeX file is *automatically compiled* to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, via this [workflow](https://github.com/noveck/cv/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_publish.yml). This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.

This repo contains [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)'s **LaTeX academic CV**, permissively licensed for others to adapt.
